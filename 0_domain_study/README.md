## Domain Summary – Violence Against Health Care in Conflict

#### What just happened?

In conflict zones around the world, hospitals are bombed, ambulances are
targeted, health workers are killed, and entire communities are cut off from
essential care. These incidents disrupt health service delivery, result in
civilian deaths, and are often either selectively reported or completely ignored
by international media.

#### What has been happening over time?

Over the past decade, the number and intensity of attacks on health care have
steadily increased, with 2024 marking a record high of 3,623 incidents globally
(SHCC, 2024). Armed conflicts in Sudan, Gaza, Ukraine, and Myanmar have featured
systematic targeting of medical infrastructure. At the same time, these events
remain under-analyzed in terms of their health impact and media visibility,
despite mounting evidence of their long-term consequences on mortality rates,
disease outbreaks, and service accessibility.

#### What are the rules, policies, and institutions contributing to the situation?

- International humanitarian law (e.g., Geneva Conventions, UNSC Resolution 2286
) prohibits attacks on health care but is frequently violated without
consequence.
- Limited data integration between health systems, humanitarian monitoring
groups, and open-source intelligence restricts visibility and timely response.
- Media systems and global politics influence which attacks are reported,
shaping global attention and donor responses.
- Weak enforcement and accountability structures leave perpetrators—especially
state actors—largely untouched.
- Fragmented national health systems lack the capacity to recover from such
violence or to document its true impact.

#### What beliefs and values keep the system in place?

- That health care in war zones is collateral, not central, to peace and
protection.
- That selective global attention to certain conflicts (e.g., Ukraine vs. Sudan)
- is justified by political interest or media viability.
- That legal frameworks are symbolic, not enforceable, in war.
- That data science is not applicable to humanitarian or health crises.
- That those closest to the problem (local communities, frontline workers) are
not trusted to shape data collection or narratives.

## Problem Statement

Attacks on health care in conflict zones have emerged as a grave, growing threat
to public health, medical neutrality, and the resilience of health systems. In
2024, the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition (SHCC) recorded 3,623
incidents of violence against or obstruction of health care across 36 countries
—a 15% increase over 2023—marking the highest number ever documented
(SHCC, 2024). These included 927 health workers killed, 473 detained, and over
1,100 facilities damaged or destroyed. The forms of violence ranged from
airstrikes and drone attacks to facility occupation, looting, and the targeting
of ambulances, maternity wards, and trauma centers.
Sudan—one of the most underreported yet severely impacted countries—accounted
for 244 such attacks in 2024, including 79 instances of facility damage, 66
health worker deaths, and 42 incidents of looted medical supplies.
Conflict-related insecurity has left fewer than 25% of health facilities
operational in high-intensity areas, with surgeries being conducted in
underground shelters using improvised tools due to lack of safety and resources
(SHCC & WHO, 2024).

These attacks are not only criminal violations under International Humanitarian
Law; they are catastrophic events that cripple health care systems, reduce
access to critical services, and intensify disease outbreaks and mortality.
The downstream consequences of these attacks are especially acute in maternal
and child health, emergency care, and chronic disease management—undermining
decades of health system development and driving long-term destabilization.
Research from the RIAH Project and WHO shows that such violence leads to a
collapse of care delivery, psychological trauma among frontline workers,
interrupted vaccination programs, and a rise in avoidable deaths in displaced
and marginalized populations (RIAH, 2024).
Yet, the global visibility and policy response to these violations remain uneven
. Some attacks—particularly in politically prominent regions—receive extensive
media coverage and prompt international outrage. Others, especially in countries
like Sudan, Myanmar, and the Sahel, are neglected or selectively reported,
skewing public awareness, aid allocation, and accountability. This disparity
raises pressing questions about how media bias, geopolitical alignment, and
data availability influence which lives and crises are considered newsworthy.
Despite the critical importance of these attacks, there remains a significant
gap in real-time, integrated data analysis that quantifies their health impacts
and media visibility. This project aims to apply data science methods to close
this gap by measuring both the health consequences and the patterns of global
awareness around attacks on healthcare in conflict zones over the past five
years.

Our team believes these events are not just humanitarian tragedies—they are
healthcare system disruptors that exacerbate disease outbreaks, increase
maternal and child mortality, and reduce long-term system resilience. Given this
context, our team recognizes the urgent need for interdisciplinary, data-driven
approaches to better understand and respond to attacks on healthcare in
conflict zones. While advanced tools like machine learning and data
visualization hold great potential, our project will focus on integrating
available datasets to track, analyze, and visualize these attacks with a
healthcare-centered lens.
By enhancing the visibility and comprehension of such violations, we aim to
support more informed decision-making by health system planners, policymakers,
and frontline healthcare workers. Ultimately, we hope our work contributes to
improving preparedness, resource allocation, and protective measures in
vulnerable conflict-affected regions.

## Research Question:

How have attacks on health care facilities in conflict zones over the last five
years impacted humanitarian access, mortality rates, and healthcare availability
, and how does media coverage vary in reporting these attacks?

### Project Goal:

To quantitatively analyze data from the last five years to measure the short-
and long-term impacts of violent attacks on healthcare services and humanitarian
aid delivery, alongside an assessment of media coverage patterns to identify
biases and underreporting — using integrated datasets (e.g., SHCC, ACLED, media
mentions) — in order to inform data-driven strategies that improve visibility
and mitigate health consequences of such attacks within 6 months.
