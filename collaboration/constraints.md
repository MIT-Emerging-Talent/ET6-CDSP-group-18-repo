# Project Constraints

This document outlines the key constraints that guide our data analysis
project, these constraints help define our scope, manage expectations,
and ensure ethical and effective project execution.

**Some boundaries around our project:**

## External

_Constraints coming from outside the
teamâ€™s control_

<!--
constraints coming from the outside that the team has no control over:
- project deadlines
- number of unit tests required to pass a code review
- technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
- power or connectivity
...
-->
### Time Constraints

- Project timeline: 13 weeks (ends Aug 25th, 2025)
- Weekly check-ins and progress reviews required
- Final presentation deadline strict

### Data Constraints

- Use publicly available/ethically sourced data
- Anonymize sensitive/personal health data
- Dataset must be relevant to defined problem
- Scope manageable within project timeline

### Technical Constraints

- Use Python-based tools (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks).
- Work within the Git/GitHub workflow (branches, issues, pull requests).
- All code should be well-documented and version-controlled.
- Use open-source tools and libraries only.

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
constraints that come from within the team, and you have no control over:
- each of the individual skill levels
- amount of time available to work on the project
...
-->
_Constraints from within the team,
not under direct control_

### Skill Levels & Availability

- Varying skill levels among team members
- Limited time each member can dedicate to the project

### Team Constraints

- Collaboration is asynchronous and cross-cultural, requiring flexibility in
  communication.
- English is the working language for all communication and documentation.

## Internal: Voluntary

_Constraints that the team decided on to help scope the project
They may include:_

### Workflow & Code Quality

- Coding style & conventions
- Agree on a code review checklist
- Number of hours to spend working
- All contributions must be made through assigned branches and reviewed via
open issues, then set up pull requests.

### Ethical Constraints

- Adhere to data privacy regulations
- Avoid bias in data selection and analysis
- Clearly acknowledge data sources
- Transparent about limitations/uncertainties
