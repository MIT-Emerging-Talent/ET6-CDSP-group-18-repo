#Project Constraints

This document outlines the key constraints that guide our data analysis
project.
These constraints help define our scope, manage expectations, and ensure
ethical and effective project execution.

---

##External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that the team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity

---

##Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within the team, and you have no control
  over:
  - each of the individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project

---

##Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that the team decided on to help scope the project.
  they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working

##Time Constraints

* Project timeline is limited to 13 weeks duration, ends on Aug 25th, 2025.
* Weekly check-ins and progress reviews are required to stay on track.
* Final presentation and submission deadlines must be strictly met.

---

##Data Constraints

* Must use publicly available or ethically sourced data.
* If using sensitive or personal health data, strict anonymization must
  be applied.
* Dataset must be relevant to the defined problem.
* Limit the scope to datasets manageable within project timeline.

---

## Ethical Constraints

* Adhere to data privacy regulations.
* Avoid bias in data selection, analysis, and interpretation.
* Clearly acknowledge data sources.
* Be transparent about any limitations or uncertainties in findings.

---

##Technical Constraints

* Use Python-based tools (e.g, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks).
* Work within the Git/GitHub workflow (branches, issues, pull requests).
* All code should be well-documented and version-controlled.
* Use open-source tools and libraries only.

---

##Team Constraints

* Collaboration is asynchronous and cross-cultural, requiring flexibility in
  communication.
* All contributions must be made through assigned branches and reviewed via
  open issues, then set up pull requests.
* English is the working language for all communication and documentation.

These constraints serve as guiding boundaries to help ensure project success,
maintain ethical standards, and promote effective teamwork.
