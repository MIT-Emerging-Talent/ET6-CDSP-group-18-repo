# Project Constraints

This document outlines the key constraints that guide our data analysis
project; These constraints help define our scope, manage expectations,
and ensure ethical and effective project execution.

Some boundaries around our project:

## External

<!--
constraints coming from the outside that the team has no control over:
- project deadlines
- number of unit tests required to pass a code review
- technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
- power or connectivity
...
-->

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
constraints that come from within the team, and you have no control over:
- each of the individual skill levels
- amount of time available to work on the project
...
-->

## Internal: Voluntary

constraints that the team decided on to help scope the project.  
They may include:

- coding style & conventions
- agree on a code review checklist
- number of hours to spend working
- only using black and white colors
...

## Time Constraints

- Project timeline: 13 weeks (ends Aug 25th, 2025)
- Weekly check-ins and progress reviews required
- Final presentation deadline strict

## Data Constraints

- Use publicly available/ethically sourced data
- Anonymize sensitive/personal health data
- Dataset must be relevant to defined problem
- Scope manageable within project timeline

## Ethical Constraints

- Adhere to data privacy regulations
- Avoid bias in data selection and analysis
- Clearly acknowledge data sources
- Transparent about limitations/uncertainties

---

## Technical Constraints

- Use Python-based tools (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks).
- Work within the Git/GitHub workflow (branches, issues, pull requests).
- All code should be well-documented and version-controlled.
- Use open-source tools and libraries only.

---

## Team Constraints

- Collaboration is asynchronous and cross-cultural, requiring flexibility in
  communication.
- All contributions must be made through assigned branches and reviewed via
  open issues, then set up pull requests.
- English is the working language for all communication and documentation.

These constraints serve as guiding boundaries to help ensure project success,
maintain ethical standards, and promote effective teamwork.
