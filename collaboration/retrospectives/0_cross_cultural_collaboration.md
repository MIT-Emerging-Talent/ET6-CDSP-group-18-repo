# Retrospective

## Team Vibe Check 😎

- **Communication status:** *Playing hide and seek with messages.*
- **General mood:** 🐢 Slow and steady wins… eventually.
- **Communication style:** Polite, patient, and sometimes telepathic.

## Stop Doing

- Assuming we're all on the same page time zones, context, and background made
things feel different for each of us.

## Continue Doing

- Being kind and supportive in our messages, even when progress was slow.
- Leaving detailed messages and clear task descriptions in GitHub and Slack.
- Respecting each other's schedules and cultural norms.

## Start Doing

- Setting weekly check-ins or async updates to avoid silences.
- Taking actions more proactively instead of waiting for perfect alignment.
- Creating space for informal chat or fun check-ins to build team warmth.
- Creating simple deadlines to give rhythm to our collaboration.

## Lessons Learned

- Cross-cultural collaboration takes more intention, assumptions don't work.
- Even if the project work was slow, we built a safe space to talk and ask for help.
- Time zones are wild. Someone’s always asleep when decisions are made.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Initial team formation and idea selection went smoothly.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Our execution lagged behind due to inactivity and unclear task ownership.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Yes. We had to clarify ownership of deliverables and add reminders and nudges
to keep momentum.

## Individual Retrospectives

### Ava

> Contributed to initial planning and research discussions. Found it challenging
to maintain momentum with limited communication from the team but appreciated
the respectful and encouraging tone throughout. Proud that we could still hold
space for each other, stay patient, and keep the project environment positive
despite the slow pace.

*We’re still figuring it out, but this milestone helped us grow as a team  in
skills, awareness and empathy too.*
