# 🧭 Milestone 1 Retrospective

## Team Vibe Check 😎

- **Communication status:** Finding our rhythm, slowly but surely.
- **General mood:** More focused, more alive, slightly overcaffeinated.
- **Collaboration style:** Respectful, curious, and surprisingly open to
unexpected ideas.

---

## Stop Doing

- Sticking to ideas just because they seem familiar or easy
(goodbye stroke and diabetes).
- Avoiding tough but meaningful topics because they feel “too big” — we're
capable of more than we thought.
- Doing the project for just doing the project.

---

## Continue Doing

- Building on each other’s ideas — from jokes about pathologist cousins to
serious debates about humanitarian ethics.
- Digging into open data sources and exploring real-world problems.
- Taking initiative to push forward when direction was unclear.

---

## Start Doing

- Balancing creativity with feasibility early in the brainstorming phase.
- Being bolder — our final topic showed we can handle complex, meaningful
issues.
- Doing the project to learn, step out of the comfort zone and having fun
(like me right now)

---

## Lessons Learned

- Topic selection is harder than it seems — there’s a lot of back and forth
between passion, practicality, and data availability.
- A joke about confidential pathology reports can actually turn into a valid
idea.
- A strong team decision doesn’t always come from the most obvious path —
sometimes it’s hidden inside a humanitarian data platform Ava stumbled on.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- We set an agenda, showed up, and had real discussions about possible
directions.
- Research was shared by multiple members, and everyone contributed their
perspective.
- A final vote helped us commit to one strong topic.

### What parts of your plan didn’t work out?

- We started with health conditions that felt too familiar (stroke, diabetes)
and realized they didn’t excite us or fit our originality goal.
- Cancer misdiagnosis was compelling but required too much clinical data and
complexity for our current scope.

### Did you need to add things that weren’t in your original plan?

- Yes — we added a full exploratory phase using the HDX platform and ended up
pivoting to a domain that felt timely and significant.
- We also had to discuss merging with another group due to early inactivity —
but we collectively decided to stay together **only if everyone stepped up**.
(Spoiler: we did.)

## Individual Reflections

### Abdulrahman

> I came in energized and suggested stroke and diabetes as possible topics,
knowing I could contribute from my medical background. Mohamed Makki brought up
cancer misdiagnosis, which sparked a fun (and very real) discussion about the
challenge of getting confidential data from family pathologists. I researched
all three options and drafted questions for each. When we discovered the HDX
humanitarian data sets — shoutout to Ava — things shifted. We discussed a lot of
options, but attacks on healthcare and aid stood out. It combined both relevance
and depth. We voted, chose it, and I volunteered to finalize the problem
statement and research question. This milestone felt like we found our
collective voice as a team — it wasn’t always smooth, but it felt authentic.

*We started with familiar diagnoses, passed through a few plot twists, and
landed on a topic that actually matters. Milestone 1 wasn't just about choosing
a question — it was about realizing the kind of team we want to be.*
