# 🩺 Data Decoders: Healthcare Data Science Project

Welcome to our group repository!

We’re a multidisciplinary team from the MIT Emerging Talent program, exploring
innovative applications of data science and technology in healthcare.

## 🧠 Current Focus

Our current research explores the intersection of **healthcare**,
**data analytics**, and **technology**.
We are investigating potential topics such as:

- Quantifying the health impacts of attacks on healthcare facilities

- Mapping gaps in humanitarian access due to targeted violence

- Visualizing attack trends using open-source and verified datasets

- Assessing policy response and legal accountability using data

- Exploring data integration models between health, humanitarian, and media systems

> ⚠️ **Note:** The project scope is still evolving as we finalize our research
question and dataset.
This repository will be updated regularly to reflect our progress.
