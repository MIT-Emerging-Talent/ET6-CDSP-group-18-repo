# Project Pathway

*Notes & Planning Document*  
*Last updated: 2025-06-25 by Ava*

## Why This Note

This document outlines a workflow made for our group’s current
focus.

Our path will evolve, especially after our first meeting with the project partner,
but this note is meant to align us ahead of time with structure shared understanding.

## Project Stages

### 1. Planning Phase

- **Define Project Goals**  
  - What outcomes are expected by our partner?  
  - What impact do we want to deliver within our limited timeline?
- **Identify & Organize Resources**  
  - Existing datasets (likely provided by the partner)  
  - Additional sources: humanitarian datasets,
  clinic-level data, geographic/demographic data, funding flows
- **Team Coordination**  
  - Map out skills, availability, and preferences  
  - Assign initial roles
  - Revisit the workflow
- **Timeline & Checkpoints**  
  - Align around internal deliverables and external deadlines  
  - Schedule recurring syncs (lightweight but consistent)

### 2. **Data Preparation Phase**

- **Access & Audit Data**  
  - Review what’s available via the partnership  
  - Check for coverage, completeness, missingness, structure
- **Clean & Standardize**  
  - Define shared cleaning protocols, scripts, naming conventions
- **Explore & Document**  
  - What’s missing, what stands out, what needs fixing?
- **Refine & Integrate**  
  - If we are using multiple sources, ensure interoperability
