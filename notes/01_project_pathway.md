# Project Pathway

*Notes & Planning Document*  
*Last updated: 2025-06-25 by Ava*

## Why This Note

This document outlines a workflow made for our group’s current
focus.

Our path will evolve, especially after our first meeting with the project partner,
but this note is meant to align us ahead of time with shared understanding.

## Project Stages

### 1. Planning Phase

- **Define Project Goals**  
  - What outcomes are expected by our partner?  
- - What *decisions* will our outputs inform?  
  - What impact do we want to deliver within our limited timeline?

- **Understand the Data**  
  - What datasets already exist internally
  (patient records, clinic reports, survey data)?  
  - What external sources can strengthen our analysis (UN/WHO, ACLED, mobile
   health data, geospatial layers)?  
  - Are there data-sharing constraints
  (legal, ethical, technical) we need to navigate early?
- **Team Coordination**  
  - Map out skills, availability, and preferences  
  - Assign initial roles
  - Revisit the workflow
- **Timeline & Checkpoints**  
  - What are the fixed dates (partner meetings, deliverables)?  
  - Schedule recurring syncs

### 2. **Data Preparation Phase**

- **Access & Audit Data**  
  - Review what’s available via the partnership  
  - Check for coverage, completeness, missingness, structure.
  Are they clean, structured, and labeled or raw, fragmented, and messy?
  - What do we *not* have yet and how critical is it?
- **Clean & Standardize**  
  - Define shared cleaning protocols, scripts, naming conventions
- **Explore & Document**  
  - What’s missing, what stands out, what needs fixing?
- **Refine & Integrate**  
  - If we are using multiple sources, ensure interoperability
  - Consider transformations
  - Are we transforming data to be interpretable for policy or field decision-making?

### Questions from team members

## Ava

- Who are the primary users Ministry of Health? local clinics? donors?
- How often data is updated, and who collects it?
- Are there known gaps or biases in what’s currently available?
- Are there any data privacy, security, or political sensitivities
   we should be aware of?
- Are there specific geographies, health conditions, or time periods
  you want us to focus on first?
