# Datasets

## 📊 Project Datasets

Welcome to the dataset directory for our collaborative data science project on
attacks on aid operations and healthcare.

The datasets stored here are used to support our research, analysis, and model
development. This repository aims to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
**All raw datasets are kept unmodified**, and cleaned or processed versions
(in later stages) will be saved separately.

---

## 📌 How to Use This Directory

- All raw datasets are saved with the `.raw` extension
(e.g., `survey_results.raw.csv`).
- Cleaned or derived datasets will be saved in later phases using descriptive
names (e.g., `survey.cleaned.csv`).
- Each dataset listed below includes:
  - **Source**
  - **Data Types**
  - **How It Was Collected**
  - **Use of the Data**
  - **How It Relates to Our Project**

## 📎 Notes

- If a dataset is updated or changed, save it as a new version with a new
filename (e.g., `datasetname.v2.raw.csv`).
