# Project Constraints

This document outlines the key constraints that guide our data analysis project.
These constraints help define our scope, manage expectations, and ensure ethical
and effective project execution.

---

## Time Constraints

* Project timeline is limited to 13 weeks total duration, ends on Aug 25th, 2025.
* Weekly check-ins and progress reviews are required to stay on track.
* Final presentation and submission deadlines must be strictly met.

---

## Data Constraints

* Must use publicly available or ethically sourced data.
* If using sensitive or personal health data, strict anonymization must be applied.
* Dataset must be relevant to the defined problem.
* Limit the scope to datasets manageable within project timeline.

---

## Ethical Constraints

* Adhere to data privacy regulations.
* Avoid bias in data selection, analysis, and interpretation.
* Clearly acknowledge data sources.
* Be transparent about any limitations or uncertainties in findings.

---

## Technical Constraints

* Use Python-based tools (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks).
* Work within the Git/GitHub workflow (branches, issues, pull requests).
* All code should be well-documented and version-controlled.
* Use open-source tools and libraries only.

---

## Team Constraints

* Collaboration is asynchronous and cross-cultural, requiring flexibility in communication.
* All contributions must be made through assigned branches and reviewed via pull
  requests. English is the working language for all communication and documentation.

These constraints serve as guiding boundaries to help ensure project success,
maintain ethical standards, and promote effective teamwork.
