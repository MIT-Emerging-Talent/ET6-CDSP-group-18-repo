# Retrospective — Milestone 0: Cross-Cultural Collaboration

## Purpose

This retrospective reflects on our team's experiences during Milestone 0 of the data
analysis project. The focus was on establishing strong foundations for cross-
cultural communication, setting collaboration norms, and organizing our workflows
effectively.

## What Went Well

- **Team Onboarding:** All members successfully joined the GitHub repository and
                       set up local development environments.
- **Repository Setup:** A structured and professional project repository was
                        established with branch protections, a pull request
                        template, and defined milestones.
- **Team Norms & Documentation:** We collaboratively created and agreed upon group
                                  norms, learning goals, constraints, and a
                                  communication plan, which fostered alignment and
                                  transparency.
- **Cross-Cultural Awareness:** Initial cultural exchange discussions helped build
                                respect, trust, and better understanding across our
                                diverse team.
- **Communication Tools:** Tools like GitHub Projects, Zoom, and asynchronous chat
                           (e.g., WhatsApp or Slack) were set up and adopted effectively.

## What Could Be Improved

- **Time Zone Coordination:** Scheduling meetings that accommodate all team members'
                              time zones remains a challenge.
- **Technical Familiarity:** Some members experienced delays due to unfamiliarity
                             with Git and GitHub workflows. More onboarding or
                             shared tutorials could help.
- **Asynchronous Check-ins:** There were some delays in feedback loops. We can
                              increase responsiveness via short async check-ins on
                              our main channel.
- **Documentation Consistency:** Minor inconsistencies in formatting were found
                                 across markdown files. A formatting guide or markdown
                                 linter might help.

## Action Items

- [x] Establish clear deadlines for async tasks with Slack/WhatsApp reminders.
- [x] Adopt a markdown style guide for future documentation.
